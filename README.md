Build a basic tabbed interface. Example:



It doesn't have to look exactly like that. Maybe it'll look better! But I want to make sure you know what I mean by "tabbed interface": The important part is that only one section is shown at a time.

Begin by copying this code into your HTML: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sumeetjain/0a9fdfb0fdff08ead860/raw/276f0110cf0dc5b0573470d84228f4b511e945de/tabs.html

For this project, you may not change the HTML at all â€“ except to add the link and script tags to the <head> section for your CSS and JavaScript.

Languages you will need to use:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
There's no Ruby or data storage of any kind for this project.

This is going to be hard. There is CSS trickery you'll need to employ, and there will be some JavaScript you'll need to research. Ask for help when you need it.

Is your tabbed interface responsive? What does that mean for a tabbed interface anyway?
